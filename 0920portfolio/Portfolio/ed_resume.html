        <p>I am a graduate of the University of Memphis(2016) and WGU Tennessee(2018). I have had an interest in programming for many years. I have worked along side of programmers on several projects that I have managed. I have been a student with CodeCrew since August 5, 2019. I have learned javascript, python, html, and css. Throughout this program I will learn full stack programming and will become a full range developer.</p>
        <p>I am currently a student of CodeCrew Code School to become a full stack developer. Through the CodeCrew Code School Boot-camp classes I was taught CSS, HTML, JavaScriot, Python, and Jquery. Having experience with using these core attributes of being a solid full stack developer makes me a well rounded developer.</p>
